#  8051 Microcontroller Development Board

##  Project Overview

This project involves the complete design and development of a custom 8051 microcontroller development board.  
The PCB was designed from scratch including schematic capture, component placement, and full routing.

The board is intended for embedded system development, testing, and learning applications.

##  Objective

- Design a standalone 8051 development  board
- Implement stable power supply and clock circuitry
- Provide accessible I/O pins for interfacing
- Create a clean and properly routed PCB layout

---

##  Features Implemented

- 8051 microcontroller core circuit
- Crystal oscillator circuit with load capacitors
- Reset circuit with pull-up configuration
- Regulated 5V power supply section
- I/O header pin breakout
- Decoupling capacitors near VCC pins
- PCB silkscreen labeling for easy debugging

---

##  PCB Design Work

- Complete schematic design
- Full PCB routing (signal + power traces)
- Proper ground routing strategy
- Track width selection based on current requirement
- Design rule check (DRC) verification
- Manufacturing-ready PCB files generated

---

##  Design Considerations

- Crystal placed close to MCU for signal stability
- Decoupling capacitors placed near supply pins
- Thin and clean signal traces
- Proper separation of power and signal paths

---

##  Files Included

- Schematic Design
- PCB Layout
- Routing Files
- Manufacturing Files (Gerbers(pdf))
- Bill of Materials (BOM)
