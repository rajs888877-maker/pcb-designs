#  AC to DC Converter (Linear Power Supply Design)

##  Project Overview

This project involves the design and development of an AC to DC regulated power supply system.  
The converter transforms AC input into stable DC output using rectification, filtering, and voltage regulation stages.

The PCB was fully designed including schematic capture, component selection, and routing optimization.
